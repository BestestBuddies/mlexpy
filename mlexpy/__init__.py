Project
=======
mlexpy -- Machine Learning Experience in Python -- is a project that we're
using to teach ourselves machine learning concepts by coding them up in
Python. These algorithms are not meant to be efficient, production-ready
implementations, but instead the simplest and most straightforward
implementations that help solidify our understanding of the concepts used.
